# Node.js MySQL Authentication and Authorization System - Microservice Architecture

This project is an Auth System built using Node.js and MySQL, following a microservice architecture. It consists of multiple microservices such as authentication and API gateway.

## Microservices

1. Authentication Service

   - Responsible for user authentication and authorization.
   - Manages user accounts, login, and registration.
   - Generates and verifies JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for secure API access.

2. API Gateway

   - Serves as the entry point for external requests to the system.
   - Provides a unified API interface for clients to communicate with various microservices.
   - Performs request validation, rate limiting, and routing to the appropriate microservice.

# Welcome to Auth Service

## Project Setup

- Clone the project on your local machine.
- Execute `npm install` in the root directory of the downloaded project.
- Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the following environment variables:
  - `PORT=<Any specified port>`
  - `PRIVATEJWT=<Your JWT secret>`
  - `MESSAGE_BROKER_URL=<Your RabbitMQ URL>`
  - `CHANNEL_NAME=<Your RabbitMQ channel name>`
  - `EXCHANGE_NAME=<Your RabbitMQ exchange name>`
  - `REMINDER_BINDING_KEY=<Your RabbitMQ binding key>`

- Inside the `src/config` folder, create a new file `config.json` and add the following JSON:

```json
{
  "development": {
    "username": "root",
    "password": "<Any password>",
    "database": "Auth_DB_Dev",
    "host": "127.0.0.1",
    "dialect": "mysql"
  }
}
```

- Once you've added your DB config as listed above, go to the `src` folder from your terminal and execute `npx sequelize db:create`.
- Then execute `npx sequelize db:migrate`.

## Database

The Auth Service interacts with the MySQL database to store user information. The necessary database tables and their structure can be found in the `database` folder.

Ensure that you have set up the database connection details correctly in the configuration file of the Auth Service.

## Setup and Configuration

To set up and run the Auth Service, follow these steps:

1. Install Node.js and MySQL if they are not already installed.

2. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/AuthService.git
   ```

3. Install the dependencies:

   ```bash
   cd authService
   npm install
   ```

4. Set up the MySQL database by creating the required tables. Refer to the SQL scripts in the `database` folder for table creation.

5. Configure the database connection details in the configuration file (`config.js`) of the Auth Service.

6. Start the Auth Service:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

## Contributing

Contributions to the Auth Service are welcome. If you find any issues or want to add new features, please open an issue or submit a pull request. Ensure that your code follows the established coding style and is well-documented.
